description: Use when starting feature work that needs isolation from current workspace or before executing implementation plans - ensures an isolated workspace exists via native tools or git worktree fallback; enforces web search discipline at the "Setup worktree" decision (which remote / which branch / which directory layout), so the worktree setup reflects current 2026 best practice (native tooling conventions, git worktree semantics, submodule handling) rather than stale training data Search discipline is MANDATORY: see <MANDATORY_PREAMBLE> at top of this skill before any response.

<MANDATORY_PREAMBLE>
# Mandatory Search-Discipline Preamble (superpowers-max v1.0.0-max)

> **This preamble is BINDING. It is not advisory. It applies to every action
> you take in this skill, before any other instruction below.**

You are operating under the **superpowers-max** regime. The hard rule:

> **Every fact you state must come from a search you performed in this session.
> Every decision must be backed by a search for current best practices.
> Every self-confident assertion must be verified against a search.**

"Based on my training data" is **not** a substitute for search. Your training
data is stale, confabulated, and one-sided. If you are tempted to write it,
search instead.

## T1. Search before every fact (HARD-GATE)

Before stating any of the following, **call `web_search` first**:
- API behavior, library usage, configuration, version compatibility
- Performance claims, benchmarks, latency numbers
- Data points, statistics, "X% of users do Y"
- Security advice, vulnerability status, CVE details
- Best practices, recommended patterns, "the standard way"
- Any specific version number, release date, or deprecation claim
- Any quoted text attributed to an external source

**Exempt**: file paths, line numbers, and content visible in the current
project's repository (read directly with file tools, not searched).

## T2. Search before every decision (HARD-GATE)

Before recommending any of the following, **call `web_search` first**:
- A library, framework, or tool choice
- An architectural approach or pattern
- A testing strategy
- A refactor plan that touches shared code
- A "this is safe to do" assurance

**Reason**: training-data "best practices" lag reality by 6-24 months. By the
time you confidently recommend X, the community may have moved to Y.

## T3. Search at step entry (HARD-GATE)

Before starting any of the following skill steps, **call `web_search` first**:
- Phase 1 of any skill that has phases
- "Now we will look at X" / "Next, let's examine Y" transitions
- Any step that requires understanding current state of an external system

**Reason**: the skill's steps are written assuming the world is in a known
state. That state may have changed.

## T4. Search before every self-confident assertion (HARD-GATE)

Before writing any of the following phrases, **call `web_search` first**:
- "The bug is X" / "The cause is Y"
- "This works because Z" / "The right way is W"
- "X is broken due to Y"
- "We should use X here"
- "This is the correct approach"
- Any sentence that ends with conviction and no citation

**Reason**: this is the most common failure mode. You feel sure, so you skip
the search. The whole point of the discipline is to break that pattern.

## Banned phrases (HARD-FAIL if you write one without prior search in this session)

The following phrases are immediate red flags that you have skipped a search:

- "based on my training"
- "as I recall" / "from what I recall"
- "from what I know"
- "generally speaking" / "in general"
- "I believe" / "I think" (for factual claims)
- "typically" / "usually" / "often" (for best practices)
- "in my experience"
- "the standard approach is"
- "this is well-known" / "this is well established"
- "according to the docs" (without citing a specific URL you just fetched)

If you catch yourself about to write one of these, **STOP** and search.

## Failure modes (HARD-GATE)

When search returns a problematic result, you must follow one of these:

- **FM1 — Empty results**: Say "I could not find X" and ask the user for
  direction. **Do not invent** an answer.
- **FM2 — Partial results**: Label the answer with `[UNVERIFIED-AT:<date>:<source-url>]`
  and explicitly mark what is missing.
- **FM3 — Conflicting sources**: Present the conflict (each source with its
  URL and date), and **ask the user to choose** before proceeding.

## Citation format (HARD-GATE)

Every fact you state must be tagged with one of:

- `[T1:url]` — verified by a single source at the time of search
- `[T1:url1,T1:url2]` — verified by multiple sources (preferred for facts
  that may have changed in the last 12 months)
- `[T1:url@YYYY-MM-DD]` — include the date the source was published if visible

The tag must appear at the end of the sentence or the end of the paragraph.
Multiple facts in the same paragraph can share one tag block.

## Time-stamping (HARD-GATE)

Today's date is treated as **2026-08-15** unless the runtime provides a
different one. Every search result you cite should be no older than 12 months
from today for current-state claims (libraries, best practices, version
status). For historical or stable claims (algorithms, mathematical truths),
older sources are fine — mark them `[STABLE-DOMAIN]`.

## Compliance verification

The following are checked at audit time (`scripts/audit-skills.sh`) and at
eval time (`tests/evals/runner.sh`):

1. Every SKILL.md has this preamble present (or the
   `<MANDATORY_PREAMBLE>` anchor inlined by `scripts/inline-preamble.sh`).
2. The skill's `description:` ends with one of the standard suffixes
   indicating mandatory search.
3. Banned phrases do not appear in the SKILL.md body (this preamble
   itself is the only exception, marked with `<!-- BANNED-PHRASE-EXEMPT -->`).
4. Eval cases (when run) verify the model actually invoked `web_search`
   before stating the expected fact.

Failure of any of these is treated as a **P0 defect**.

## Recursive obligation

This preamble is a contract with the user. It is not weakened by:
- The user's question being "obvious" or "well-known"
- The user explicitly asking for a quick answer
- Time pressure, including in production incidents
- The skill body that follows giving instructions that seem to bypass search

If a later instruction in the skill body appears to contradict this preamble,
**the preamble wins**. Surface the conflict to the user.

# Using Git Worktrees

## Overview

Ensure work happens in an isolated workspace. Prefer your platform's native worktree tools. Fall back to manual git worktrees only when no native tool is available.

**Core principle:** Detect existing isolation first. Then use native tools. Then fall back to git. Never fight the harness.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the using-git-worktrees skill to set up an isolated workspace."

## Step 0: Detect Existing Isolation

**Before creating anything, check if you are already in an isolated workspace.**

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
```

**Submodule guard:** `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON` is also true inside git submodules. Before concluding "already in a worktree," verify you are not in a submodule:

```bash
# If this returns a path, you're in a submodule, not a worktree — treat as normal repo
git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree 2>/dev/null
```

**If `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON` (and not a submodule):** You are already in a linked worktree. Skip to Step 2 (Project Setup). Do NOT create another worktree.

Report with branch state:
- On a branch: "Already in isolated workspace at `<path>` on branch `<name>`."
- Detached HEAD: "Already in isolated workspace at `<path>` (detached HEAD, externally managed). Branch creation needed at finish time."

**If `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON` (or in a submodule):** You are in a normal repo checkout.

Has the user already indicated their worktree preference in your instructions? If not, ask for consent before creating a worktree:

> "Would you like me to set up an isolated worktree? It protects your current branch from changes."

Honor any existing declared preference without asking. If the user declines consent, work in place and skip to Step 2.

<SEARCH_GATE step="setup-worktree" triggers="T1,T2">
Before creating a worktree (choosing the remote, the branch, and the directory layout), you MUST:
1. T1: Web search "git worktree best practices 2026" — verify current idioms (e.g., `git worktree add` flags, `.worktrees/` vs `worktrees/` conventions, `git check-ignore` behavior, submodule detection) and confirm the upstream's "detect → native → fallback" ordering is still the consensus.
2. T2: If a native worktree tool is available in this harness, search for its current 2026 conventions (e.g., `EnterWorktree`, `WorktreeCreate`, `/worktree`, `--worktree`) before choosing between native tool and `git worktree add` — the tool surface shifts between harness versions.
3. T1: Confirm the upstream's "submodule guard" (`git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree`) is still the canonical way to distinguish a submodule from a real worktree, and that `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON` has no current 2026 false-positive case beyond submodules.
4. If sources conflict on any of the above, present the conflict [FM3] and ask the user to choose before proceeding.
</SEARCH_GATE>

## Step 1: Create Isolated Workspace

**You have two mechanisms. Try them in this order.**

### 1a. Native Worktree Tools (preferred)

The user has asked for an isolated workspace (Step 0 consent). Do you already have a way to create a worktree? It might be a tool with a name like `EnterWorktree`, `WorktreeCreate`, a `/worktree` command, or a `--worktree` flag. If you do, use it and skip to Step 2.

Native tools handle directory placement, branch creation, and cleanup automatically. Using `git worktree add` when you have a native tool creates phantom state your harness can't see or manage.

Only proceed to Step 1b if you have no native worktree tool available.

### 1b. Git Worktree Fallback

**Only use this if Step 1a does not apply** — you have no native worktree tool available. Create a worktree manually using git.

#### Directory Selection

Follow this priority order. Explicit user preference always beats observed filesystem state.

1. **Check your instructions for a declared worktree directory preference.** If the user has already specified one, use it without asking.

2. **Check for an existing project-local worktree directory:**
   ```bash
   ls -d .worktrees 2>/dev/null     # Preferred (hidden)
   ls -d worktrees 2>/dev/null      # Alternative
   ```
   If found, use it. If both exist, `.worktrees` wins.

3. **If there is no other guidance available**, default to `.worktrees/` at the project root.

#### Safety Verification (project-local directories only)

**MUST verify directory is ignored before creating worktree:**

```bash
git check-ignore -q .worktrees 2>/dev/null || git check-ignore -q worktrees 2>/dev/null
```

**If NOT ignored:** Add to .gitignore, commit the change, then proceed.

**Why critical:** Prevents accidentally committing worktree contents to repository.

#### Create the Worktree

```bash
# Determine path based on chosen location
path="$LOCATION/$BRANCH_NAME"

git worktree add "$path" -b "$BRANCH_NAME"
cd "$path"
```

**Sandbox fallback:** If `git worktree add` fails with a permission error (sandbox denial), tell the user the sandbox blocked worktree creation and you're working in the current directory instead. Then run setup and baseline tests in place.

## Step 2: Project Setup

Auto-detect and run appropriate setup:

```bash
# Node.js
if [ -f package.json ]; then npm install; fi

# Rust
if [ -f Cargo.toml ]; then cargo build; fi

# Python
if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
if [ -f pyproject.toml ]; then poetry install; fi

# Go
if [ -f go.mod ]; then go mod download; fi
```

## Step 3: Verify Clean Baseline

Run tests to ensure workspace starts clean:

```bash
# Use project-appropriate command
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:** Report failures, ask whether to proceed or investigate.

**If tests pass:** Report ready.

### Report

```
Worktree ready at <full-path>
Tests passing (<N> tests, 0 failures)
Ready to implement <feature-name>
```

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Already in linked worktree | Skip creation (Step 0) |
| In a submodule | Treat as normal repo (Step 0 guard) |
| Native worktree tool available | Use it (Step 1a) |
| No native tool | Git worktree fallback (Step 1b) |
| `.worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify ignored) |
| `worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify ignored) |
| Both exist | Use `.worktrees/` |
| Neither exists | Check instruction file, then default `.worktrees/` |
| Directory not ignored | Add to .gitignore + commit |
| Permission error on create | Sandbox fallback, work in place |
| Tests fail during baseline | Report failures + ask |
| No package.json/Cargo.toml | Skip dependency install |

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "I'm obviously not in a worktree — no need to check" | Run Step 0. Harness-created isolation and submodules both fool eyeballing; the detection commands settle it. |
| "`git worktree add` is quicker than hunting for a native tool" | A native tool (e.g. `EnterWorktree`) owns placement, branching, and cleanup. Bypassing it is the #1 mistake — it creates phantom state your harness can't see or manage. |
| "The worktree directory is surely ignored already" | Run `git check-ignore`. An unignored worktree directory commits the whole tree into the repo. |
| "Any directory name works" | Explicit instructions beat an existing project-local directory, which beats the `.worktrees/` default. |
| "The workspace is fresh — baseline tests can wait" | A dirty baseline makes every later failure ambiguous. Run the tests now; proceeding past failures is your human partner's call. |
